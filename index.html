						"The world has always been in the middle of things, in unruly and practical conversation, full of action and structured by a startling array of actants and of networking and unequal collectives"

						"Form and content are short-lived, and this makes them false starters. In a politics attuned to emergent difference, we must begin instead in the midst, where force has not yet tuned to form. In this middle, where the event is still welling, there is potential for new diagrams of life-living to be drawn"

					"To read diffractively implies a certain *suddenness*"

					(Iris van der Tuin, "Signals Falling")
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					"Diffraction does not produce 'the same' displaced, as reflection and refraction do. Diffraction is a mapping of interference, not of replication, reflection, or reproduction. A diffraction pattern does not map where differences appear, but rather maps where the *effects* of difference appear ... Science fiction is generically concerned with the interpenetration of boundaries between problematic selves and unexpected others and with the exploration of possible worlds in a context structured by transnational technoscience"

					(Haraway, "The Promise of Monsters")
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					*Ordinary Affects* is an experiment, not a judgement (Stewart, *Ordinary Affects*)

					"Full of resonating stories, encounters quirky in their unapologetic ordinariness, and murmuring objects, this book takes me into the thick world of the everyday in the U.S.A." (Haraway on *Ordinary Affects*)
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					"Meaning is not an ideality; meaning is material. And matter isn't what exists separately from meaning. Mattering is a matter of what comes to matter and what doesn't. Difference isn't given. It isn't fixed. Subject and object, wave and particle, position and momentum do not exist outside of specific intra-actions that enact cuts that make separations--not absolute separations, but only contingent separations" ("Diffracting Diffraction" 175)
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					"Reading diffractively is a methodology that wants to stay clear from classifactory reading (reading *from* or *for* an authoritative classification of ideas, a regulation of dependence that is often implicit and stays unacknowledged)" (van der Tuin, "Signals Falling" 112)

					"...the diffractive method allows us to affirm links between seemingly opposite schools of thought, thus breaking through a politics of negation. At the same time, it allows us to affirm and strengthen links between schools of thought or scholars that only *apparently* work toward the same goals. Diffraction, then, is the strategy with which new concepts or traditions, new philosophies, can be engendered" (van der Tuin "A Different Starting Point, A Different Metaphysics" 27)
